Your task is to:
- Compare the time and projects between TODAY and YESTERDAY.
- ONLY use the entries listed under each specific date â€” never infer or carry over tasks between days.
- Do not assume any project happened on both days unless it appears in both TODAY and YESTERDAY sections.
- Assign a productivity score for TODAY (0â€“100), based on time usage, task quality, and inclusion of rest or walking breaks.
- Suggest 2â€“3 improvements to my time usage. Breaks and walking are considered positive.
- Your output should be in clean markdown.

Important: Do NOT hallucinate or infer data. ONLY use the fields explicitly provided under each date.
